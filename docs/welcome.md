All of the resources you need to unlock the power of the platform.

## Getting started with GeoSIS

**GeoSIS** is the only cloud-first spatial platform built for accelerated, modern GIS. 
It runs natively on top of your cloud data warehouse platform (e.g. Google BigQuery,
Snowflake, AWS Redshift, etc.), providing easy access to highly scalable spatial
analysis and visualization capabilities in the cloud â€” be it for analytics, 
app development, data engineering, and more.
